# RentEasy – A Trustworthy Rental Platform

## Hackathon Theme
**Cybersecurity & Trust** – Building trust and reducing fraud in digital services.

---

## Project Overview
In Nigeria, youths, students, and workers face a severe housing crisis. Finding safe, affordable accommodation is stressful and risky due to scams, fake landlords, and unverified agents. There is no centralized, trustworthy platform for rentals, short stays, or shared housing, causing users to waste time, money, and energy.

**RentEasy** is a digital housing and rental platform designed to make finding, paying for, and managing accommodation **safe, transparent, and reliable**. The platform focuses on **trust and fraud prevention** within the rental ecosystem.

---

## Problem Statement
Scams in the rental market are rampant in Nigeria:

- Fake landlords and agents take advantage of desperate tenants  
- Listings are often unverified or misleading  
- No central platform exists to authenticate properties or landlords  

This situation causes financial loss, stress, and a lack of trust among users. RentEasy addresses these problems by ensuring **authenticity, transparency, and reliability** for tenants and landlords.

## Solution & Implementation
RentEasy provides a secure and user-friendly platform with the following key features:

1. **Verified Housing Listings**  
   - Each listing is manually verified to ensure authenticity.

2. **Authenticated Landlords & Properties**  
   - Landlords must register with valid ID and contact information.

3. **Digital Tenancy Contracts**  
   - Protects both tenants and landlords by providing legally recognized agreements.

4. **Flexible Rent Payment Options**  
   - Users can pay monthly or quarterly to suit diverse financial needs.

5. **Automated Scam Detection**  
   - The system flags suspicious listings using predefined rules such as duplicate listings, abnormal pricing, or unverifiable landlord information.
